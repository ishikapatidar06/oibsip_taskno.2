              Rani Lakshmi Bai or Jhansi ki Rani, one of the most important
              figures of India's First War of Independence, died while fighting
              against the British in Gwalior on 18th June 1858. Today is her
              158th death anniversary.

              India’s freedom struggle had seen many freedom fighters over the
              years, but the name of Rani Lakshmibai stands out among them.
              Manikarnika Tambe, later Rani Lakshmibai of the princely state of
              Jhansi, was a brave and fearless woman who fought courageously
              against the British.

              Lord Dalhousie adopted the “doctrine of lapse” – allowing the
              British to annex an Indian state if the ruler did not have a male
              heir. Resistance to the policy, and the subsequent Great Rebellion
              of 1857 brought the Rani of Jhansi – the young widow of the last
              ruler of the state of Jhansi – into the political spotlight.

              The British army led by Major-General Sir Hugh Rose attacked
              Jhansi in March 1858 and laid siege to the fort. In June 1858,
              20,000 Indian rebels led by the Rani mounted an attack on Rose’s
              forces outside Gwalior. And it was here that the queen met her
              death. Three days after the death of Lakshmibai, the British
              captured the Fort of Gwalior.

              Lakshmibai's name lives on right until this day in 1942, an
              all-women regiment of the Indian National Army was named in honour
              of the Rani of Jhansi. Lakshmibai has also inspired generations of
              poets, writers, and filmmakers who have tried to capture the
              essence of who Lakshmibai really was.
